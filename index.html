                “One broken window—a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the duration of the project—is all it takes to start the decline. <br><br>
                If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it's all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I'll just follow suit." It doesn't matter if the project has been fine up to this point. <br><br>
                In the original experiment leading to the "Broken Window Theory," an abandoned car sat for a week untouched. But once a single window was broken, the car was stripped and turned upside down within hours. By the same token, if you find yourself on a team and a project where the code is pristinely beautiful—cleanly written, well designed, and elegant—you will likely take extra special care not to mess it up, just like the firefighters. Even if there's a fire raging (deadline, release date, trade show demo, etc.), you don't want to be the first one to make a mess.”

                <h1>Code Smell</h1>
                <p>Code Smell can be misleading. It doesn't mean that something is broken - or even that there is a tangible bug. It refers to more of an intuition - one based in a set of theories and practices aligned with a school of thought. In respect to programing they are not even things that are technically incorrect - rather they most often indicate overarching weaknesses in design that inhibit future development or increase the risk for bugs and / or failures over the lifetime of the program.</p>
                <p>"Common wisdom suggests that urgent maintenance activities and pressure to deliver features while prioritizing time-to-market over code quality are often the causes of such smells"</p>

                    Complexity is an <a target="_blank" href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/graphics/ch13.pdf">Interesting</a> subject.<br>
                    In software it is something to be avoided at all costs. <br>

                <p>
                    There are many ways to solve a problem - when choosing the right solution - looking at the projected complexity of the problem at hand can help guide the applications general development.<br> e.g. when choosing between active record and data mapper when implementing a model layer.

                    In general despite the complexity of behaviour software may produce - it should not itself be complex.<br>
                    Rather seemingly complex software should be decomposed into simple ideally idempotent pieces which interact through strictly defined interfaces. ( its hard )

            <h1>(T)DRY</h1>
            <p>If you are about to duplicate some code.  Pause - stop and think.  If the thing you are doing can be abstracted out into a function or service without confounding the operation you are trying to accomplish - then do this.</p>

            <p>The T is for TRY - because sometimes under pressure we need to do horrible things. We are also have our humanity with all its flaws. We should do our best to take note of these things and make efforts to fix them.</p>
            <p>Knowing adding to code debt - and NOT fixing it - is like leaving dishes in the sink because you're rushing to work - but never doing them when you get home. Don't be this person.</p>

                    <li><b>Type Definition</b> - defined interfaces which represent types - these types of behavioural objects.</li>

                <h2>Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h2>
                <p>
                    This refers to the interoperability of objects or entities within an inheritance hierarchy.  <br>
                    Derived types should be semantically equivalent to the anticipated behavior of its base type.
                </p>
                <p>There are strategies employed to mitigate violating the LSP in certain situations - to completely avoid LSP violations would require anticipating every possible way a library of module was to be used.</p>

                <h4>Contacts</h4>
                <p>Use contacts to defined interfaces between caller and callee. <br>A contracts can either manifest itself as executable specifications ( in many compiled languages this is built in ) <br>or with pre-conditions and error checking on misuse of a given entity in a specific context( in languages like common js ).</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Avoid inheritance</h4>
                <p>Deep inheritance trees  lead to rigid architecture which is tightly coupled and hard to modify.  Prefer composition over inheritance.  There are two main advantages. Composition tends to lead to smaller more focused objects which thus are easier to maintain - and with traditional inheretence - because all types are directly derived from a base type - changes in the base type can inadvertantly cause issues downstream.</p>

                <h2>Classic Example</h2>
                <p>Say we have an application that uses a rectangle object defined as follows:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-trim>
var rectangle = {
    length: 0,
    width: 0
};
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Later, we decide that this application has some requirement to work with squares.</p>
                <p>We know that a square is a rectangle whose sides are equal in length. So it is decided to REPLACE the rectangle object with the seemingly comparable square.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-trim>
var square = {};
(function() {
    var length = 0, width = 0;
    Object.defineProperty(square, "length", {
        get: function() { return length; },
        set: function(value) { length = width = value; }
    });
    Object.defineProperty(square, "width", {
        get: function() { return width; },
        set: function(value) { length = width = value; }
    });
})();
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>We use property setters and getters to ensure that our square keeps in lengths and widths in sync.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>What about our rectangle?</h2>
                <p>Sadly it is discovered that when our application attempts to use this square in place of the initial rectangle. The area that the application later computes is incorrect</p>
                <p>The following code is our area function</p>
                <pre>
                    <code data-trim>
var g = function(rectangle) {
    rectangle.length = 3;
    rectangle.width = 4;
    write(rectangle.length);
    write(rectangle.width);
    write(rectangle.length * rectangle.width);
};
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>When we invoke this object with a square in place of the original rectangle - we end up with the product of 16 rather than the expected 12.</p>
                <p>Our square breaks the LSP in respect to function g.</p>

                <h3>Fixing </h3>
                <p>Correcting this type of situation would require the design of shape objects and the application which consumes them / its functions therein.</p>
                <p>Perhaps a more flexible approach implement squares and rectangles in terms of polygons.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It's not about literal inheritance it's about BEHAVIOUR.  Just as a for hard drive connections - no matter which brand or size or style - the interface for the connection is ALWAYS compatible and "plugs in" just as any other </p>

                <h2>Interface segregation principle (ISP)</h2>
                <p>
                    "Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use"<br><br>
                    Similar to the SRP in that both deal with the cohesion of responsibility inside of an application. You could even say that the ISP is the application of the SRP to an objects public interface.
                </p>
                <p>An example of this is when clients depend upon objects which contain methods only consumed by other clients, OR are forced to implement unused methods in order to adhere to an interface.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Fundamentally we are concerned with the containment and access of "knowledge" within each object which composes our application.  In practice this is a very semantic thing.</p>

                <h3>But wait - javascript doesn't have interfaces</h3>
                <p>What is an interface? If by interfaces we mean some abstract type provided by the language to establish contracts and decoupling, then yes javascript does not have interfaces.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Every operation declared by an object specifies the operation’s name, the objects it takes as parameters, and the operation’s return value. This is known as the operation’s signature. The set of all signatures defined by an object’s operations is called the interface to the object. An object’s interface characterizes the complete set of requests that can be sent to the object.

                <h3>Mainly effects statically typed languages</h3>
                <p>In statically-typed languages like C++ or Java you have direct consequences for not adhering to this ISP</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Degenerate Implementations</b> - all methods MUST be declared by an implementation of an interface ( or it won't compile ) - so you end up having to stub out functions that do nothing - or throw exceptions based on misuse. </li>
                    <li><b>Static Coupling</b> - In statically typed languages interfaces are fundamental to the overall design of a loosely coupled system.   </li>
